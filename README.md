Pluris
======

Extra prototypes and utilities for the [Eris](https://npmjs.com/package/eris) Discord API Library

# WARNING
This package has been archived. I will no longer be providing support for pluris. If you want to hack/port this for other features, feel free to do so, but please don't be disappointed if I don't give you support.

---
Installation and Usage
----------------------
You will need to have at least Eris v0.15.0 installed. Previous versions of Eris may work but will not be tested for compatibility with the current version of Pluris. You must also make sure that other packages do not conflict with Pluris.

```sh
$ npm i pluris
```
After installing Pluris, make sure you initialise Eris with Pluris
```js
const Eris = require('eris');
require('pluris')(Eris);
```
You will only need to do this once, preferably in your main bot file. To disable specific plugins, supply an object in the second parameter with the plugin name set to false. See below for a list of available plugins
```js
const Eris = require('eris');
require('pluris')(Eris, { awaitMessages: false });
```
Setting the plugin to `true` will keep the plugin enabled

TypeScript
----------
This package includes some documentation updates for Eris. I have tried to overwrite the typings as best as I can, however if there are any errors or issues, please let me know.

Need some help?
---------------
Feel free to contact me by joining either servers:
- [Axon Labs](https://discord.gg/QZ6B5US) (preferred) in the #other-support channel
- [Dyno](https://discord.gg/dyno) (most active) in the #code-dev channel, by running `?rank Code` in #commands when joining the server
- I kindly ask you not to use the Eris #support channel or the #js_eris channel in Discord API so that these channels can be focused on Eris itself
